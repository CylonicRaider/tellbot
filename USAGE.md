# tellbot usage

`@TellBot` has reached all of its intended functionality, and development is
restricted to maintenance. The command set may change upon popular demand or
developer decision.

## Commands

Aside from the mandatory commands from the
["botrulez"](https://github.com/jedevc/botrulez), `@TellBot` implements the
following concrete commands:

- [`!inbox`](#inbox) — Check own mailbox.
- [`!tell` a.k.a. `!tnotify`](#tell-or-tnotify) — Send messages.
- [`!reply` / `!reply-all`](#reply-and-reply-all) — Reply to a message.
- [`!tgroup` / `!tungroup`](#tgroup-and-tungroup) — Manage groups of users.
- [`!tgrouplist`](#tgrouplist) — List the members of a group.
- [`!tlistgroups`](#tlistgroups) — List groups (filtering by name).
- [`!tgroupsof`](#tgroupsof) — List groups a user is in.
- [`!alias`](#alias-and-unalias) — Manage aliases of a user.
- [`!seen`](#seen) — Report when a user was last seen.

### !inbox

    !inbox [--stale]

Deliver the pending notifies to yourself. If `--stale` is passed, also post
messages again that were delivered to you (this can be tried as a last effort
of error recovery).

To immediately comment on the messages, you can also (after a `--` separator)
post comments in the same message as the command; this is discouraged and may
change in the future.

If a user has been away for a long time (_i.e._ more than two days),
`@TellBot` does not deliver notifies immediately upon any message of the
recipient (as some other bots do), but instead shows a notification, which
advises to use this command.

#### Examples

    !inbox
      No mail.

    !inbox
      [You, 2d 5m ago] message

    !inbox --stale
      [You, 2d 5m 13s ago] message

### !tell or !tnotify

    !tell [--ping] [--priority=<level>] <user-list> [--] <message>
    !tnotify [--ping] [--priority=<level>] <user-list> [--] <message>

Schedule `message` to be delivered to all users in the given
[`user-list`](#user-lists). A `--` separator may be used to separate the
recipients from the message body (such as when the message starts with an
@-mention); it is not included in the delivered message. (To send a message
starting with a double dash, duplicate the separator.)

`@TellBot` displays a breakdown of the users the message will actually be
delivered to as a reply to the command. Unless `--ping` is passed, users on
the list are not @-mentioned to allow sending messages of low importance
without disturbing the recipients.

Each message has an associated priority that determines whether and with how
much effort the recipient will be notified of it (_i.e._, currently, whether
an email notification will be sent if the user has opted in). Matching is
case-insensitive. The priority levels are:

- `LOW`: A notification will never be sent.
- `NORMAL`: A notification will be sent if the user had been away for some
  time (the default is a week) and has not received another notification in
  some time (the default is a week as well).
- `URGENT`: A notification will be dispatched immediately and
  unconditionally. To prevent abuse, this level is only available to room
  hosts (and/or site staff).

If the message is empty (or consists of only whitespace), it is dropped (and
the potential recipients are not notified), but the list of recipients is
still displayed; this may be useful to observe the effects of different user
list operations (see the [corresponding section](#user-lists)). Leading or
trailing whitespace is stripped from the message; whitespace "inside" the
message is unaltered.

If you submit a message to a group you are a member of and do not explicitly
include yourself as a recipient, you will be dropped from the recipient list;
this aids messaging groups without redundantly showing you the text you
presumably already read while composing it. Explicit mention of yourself is
interpreted as the explicit intent of delivering the message to yourself.

`!tell` and `!tnotify` are exactly equivalent; the latter is provided for
closeness to the corresponding `@NotBot` command.

#### Examples

    !tell @person1 something

    !tnotify @person2 @person3 something else

    !tell *group -- @somebot stopped working, can you check?

#### !notify

    !notify [--ping] [--priority=<level>] <user-list> [--] <message>

Depending on the configuration, `@TellBot` may respond to a `!notify` command
in the same way as to a `!tell`, either immediately, or after a delay (and
unless something else does), or not at all. This (if enabled) renders
`@TellBot` a failsafe for a `@NotBot` instance running in the same room, in
case the latter goes down.

### !reply and !reply-all

    !reply <message>
    !reply-all <message>

If (and only if) used as direct replies to delivered messages that are not
older than some implementation-defined time (_i.e._ two days), these commands
will send a message back to the sender of the received message (`!reply`) or
the group the message was sent to (`!reply-all`). If the message was not sent
to a group, `!reply-all` behaves like `!reply`.

The message starts immediately after the command (and can in particular start
with any character). Implicit self exclusion happens in the case of
`!reply-all`, and does not happen for `!reply`.

#### Examples

    [You, 5s ago] some message
      !reply some reply

    [person to *group, 5s ago] another message
      !reply Can you clarify that a bit?

    [person to *group, 5s ago] yet another message
      !reply-all another reply

### !tgroup and !tungroup

    !tgroup [--ping] *<group> [<user-list>] [-- <description>]
    !tungroup [--ping] *<group> <user-list>

`!tgroup` updates the given `group` with the result of building
[`user-list`](#user-lists) basing upon it. If `user-list` is empty, the
members of the group are displayed without mutating it.

`!tungroup` removes all members of `user-list` (starting with an empty
set) from the group. Note that the `user-list` must be nonempty; otherwise,
the command has no effect.

Unless `--ping` is passed, user names are not @-mentioned to avoid
unnecessary alerting.

If `description` is passed, subsequent queries of that group will display
it until it is replaced.

#### Examples

    !tgroup *group @person1 @person2
      Group: *group
      Members before: -none-
      Members after (2): person1, person2

    !tgroup --ping *group
      Group: *group
      Members (2): @person1, @person2

    !tgroup *group -*group -- A demonstration group.
      Group: *group
      New description: A demonstration group.
      Members before (2): person1, person2
      Members after: -none-

    !tgroup *group
      Group: *group
      Description: A demonstration group.
      Members: -none-

#### !tgrouplist

    !tgrouplist [--ping] *<group>

`!tgrouplist` is an alias for `!tgroup` that only allows listing a group. It
is provided for closeness to the corresponding `@NotBot` command.

### !tlistgroups

    !tlistgroups [pattern]

Enumerate all groups (or those whose name without the `*` sigil match a
globbing `pattern`) known to `@TellBot`. The output is alphabetically
sorted.

#### Pattern syntax

`pattern` may not contain whitespace, and can include the following
metacharacters:

-   `?` matches an arbitrary single character.

    To match a literal question mark, enclose it in a character class (_i.e._
    use `[?]`; see below).

-   `*` matches an arbitrary amount of arbitrary characters (including none).

    To match a literal asterisk, enclose it — similarly to the question
    mark — in a character class (_i.e._ use `[*]`).

-   `[` initiates a _character class_ that matches one character of any such
    mentioned in it; it is closed by a `]`, and the `[` may be immediately
    followed by `!` denoting a negative match; character ranges (separated by
    dashes `-`) are allowed.

    To include a closing bracket (`]`), place it immediately after the
    opening bracket (`[`) or the negation sign (`!`); to include a dash,
    place it at the beginning (similarly to `]`) or end (immediately before
    the closing `]`) of the character class. Nested opening brackets are not
    treated specially.

    Thus, `[][]` matches a closing or an opening bracket; `[!]]` matches
    any single character but a closing bracket; `[?-]` matches a question
    mark or a hyphen; `[a-z]` matches a letter of (see below) any case.

The pattern must match the entire group name (ignoring case); to "de-anchor"
it from an end, use leading or trailing asterisks `*`.

#### Examples

    !tlistgroups
      *anyquestions?
      *botdevs
      *groupA, *groupB, *groupC, *groupD
      *test, *testing

    !tlistgroups group?
      *groupA, *groupB, *groupC, *groupD

    !tlistgroups *st*
      *anyquestions?
      *test, *testing

    !tlistgroups [gt]*
      *groupA, *groupB, *groupC, *groupD
      *test, *testing

    !tlistgroups *[c-g]
      *groupC, *groupD
      *testing

    !tlistgroups *[?]
      *anyquestions?

### !tgroupsof

    !tgroupsof [--ping] <user-list>

Reply with the groups the users in [`user-list`](#user-lists) are members of.

Unless `--ping` is specified, users are not pinged.

#### Examples

    !tgroupsof @user1
      Groups of user1: -none-

    !tgroupsof --ping @user2
      Groups of @user2 (1): *group1

    !tgroupsof *group1
      Groups of user2 (1): *group1
      Groups of user3 (3): *group1, *group2, and *group3

### !alias and !unalias

    !alias [--ping] @<user> [<user-list>]
    !unalias [--ping] @<user> <user-list>

Alias together multiple users (along with all their former aliases) and/or
remove some aliases of a user.

`!alias` builds the given [`user-list`](#user-lists) — which may not contain
groups — starting from the current set of aliases of `user`, extends the list
by all other aliases of users contained in the list (*except* `user`), and
installs the result as a new alias list instead of the former one of `user`
(and any added members).

`!unalias` builds the `user-list` — which again may contain no groups —
starting from the empty list and removes the entries of `user-list` from the
alias list of `user`; it cannot add new aliases.

Unless `--ping` is passed, user names are not @-mentioned to avoid
unnecessary alerting.

For consistency's sake, a user is always considered to have a one-entry alias
set if no other aliases are present (or the observable behavior should be
equivalent to that).

Aliases interact with the other features of `@TellBot` primarily at the time
of retrieval. A group some members whereof have been aliased together retains
all members _per se_ (although only one is displayed); when it is modified,
however, only one of the aliases is written back. Messages are stored with
the recipient originally indicated, and are delivered to which alias ever of
that user appears first. Information about when a user has been seen is
stored per original name, and the results for all aliases of a user are
aggregated when the information is actually requested.

Hence, creating and removing an alias again would not have too many grave
consequences if other information concerning that user is not accessed in the
meantime.

#### Examples

    !alias @user1 @user2 @user3
      Aliases of @user1 before: user1
      Aliases of @user1 after: user1, user2, and user3

    !alias --ping @userA @userB @userX
      Aliases of @userA before: @userA
      Aliases of @userA after: @userA, @userB, and @userX

    !unalias @userX @userX
      Aliases of @userX before: userA, userB, and userX
      Aliases of @userA after: userA and userB

    !alias @user1 @userA
      Aliases of @user1 before: user1, user2, and user3
      Aliases of @user1 after: user1, user2, user3, userA, and userB

    !alias --ping @test
      Aliases of @test: @test

### !seen

    !seen <user-list>

Reply with time intervals since the users in [`user-list`](#user-lists) were
last seen (_i.e._ posted something in a room observed by `@TellBot` whilst it
was running), the rooms they were in, and counts of messages pending delivery
to them.

#### Examples

    !seen @person1
      @person1 last seen here on {some date}, 5m 2s ago.

    !seen @person2
      @person2 not seen (3 pending messages).

    !seen *group
      @person3 last seen here on {some date}, 1d 4h 5s ago (1 pending message).
      @person4 last seen in &test on {some date}, 41d 23h 59m ago.

## User lists

`@TellBot` uses a moderately powerful array of incremental set operations to
allow specifying sets of users.

A **user list** (actually an ordered set) is built starting with a *base*
(that is empty where not explicitly mentioned) and changing it in accord with
certain operations in the order the latters are given. These operations are:

- `+@<nick>`: Add the specified user to the user list (if not already
  present).
- `+*<group>`: Add all members to the user list (for each, if not already
  present).
- `-@<nick>`: Remove the specified user from the list (if present).
- `-*<group>`: Remove all members of the group from the user list (for each,
  if present).
- `@nick`: A "bare" nickname is equivalent to adding the user.
- `*group`: A "bare" group name is equivalent to adding the group.

Hence, `+` is equivalent to the set union operator, and `-` to the set
difference operator; applied to the unitary set containing the specified user
in one case, or to the set of the members of a group in the other. Beyond
the set semantics, the operators attempt to maintain the relative order of
users; the addition operators append "new" users to the end of the list.
Therefore, removing a user and re-adding them will result in pushing them to
the end.

The order of users does not have any effect _per se_, but is preserved upon
display; it also affects the group listing shortening in the bot's response
to `!tell` (_i.e._ the omitting of users already mentioned elsewhere in the
response).

**Note** that the operations are not commutative: `-@user +@user` will have
a different effect from both `+@user -@user` and discarding both operations
(respectively, the user will shifted to the end of the list, the user will
be removed, the user will not be affected at all).

#### Examples

For basic examples, see the respective commands.

- `!tell @person1 @person2 @person1 message` — Deliver a message to @person1
  and @person2 (_i.e._, the message will *not* reach @person1 twice).
- `!tell *programmers -*botdevs message` — Deliver a message to all
  programmers except the bot developers.
- `!tgroup *programmers` — Do not alter *programmers (the special case
  mentioned in the documentation of `!tgroup` is equivalent to what would
  happen if it were not there).
- `!tgroup *programmers *botdevs` — Add all bot developers to *programmers.
- `!tgroup *programmers -*programmers` — Remove all members from *programmers
  (_i.e._ clear the group).
